## Application Overview

CannaJournal is built on a solid foundation using modern web technologies:

- **Expo**: For cross-platform mobile app development
- **Supabase**: Backend as a Service for authentication and data storage
- **Expo Router**: For seamless navigation
- **TypeScript**: For enhanced type safety
- **NativeWind**: Tailwind CSS for React Native, providing utility-first styling
- **React Hook Form**: For efficient form handling
- **Zod**: For schema validation

## Project Configuration

The project is configured with:

- **ESLint**: For identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Prettier**: For code formatting
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking
- **Absolute imports**: For cleaner import statements

For detailed configuration, refer to the `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.js`, and `.prettierrc` files in the project root.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```
root
|
+-- app               # Contains all screens and layouts (Expo Router)
|
+-- assets            # Static assets (images, fonts, icons)
|
+-- components        # Reusable React components
|
+-- config            # Configuration files
|
+-- context           # React Context providers
|
+-- lib               # Utility functions and constants
```

## Components And Styling

CannaJournal uses a component-based architecture with NativeWind for styling:

- Custom UI components are located in the `components` directory
- Styling is done using Tailwind CSS classes via NativeWind
- The app supports both light and dark modes

## State Management

- **Form State**: Managed using React Hook Form
- **Global State**: Handled through React Context (see `context` directory)
- **Data Persistence**: Achieved using Supabase
